## Static Analysis: 
Static analysis is a method of examining the source code of a software program without executing it. Static analysis can help detect errors, bugs, vulnerabilities, and other quality issues in the code. Static analysis tools can perform various tasks such as checking syntax, style, logic, data flow, control flow, and security. Static analysis can improve the reliability, performance, and maintainability of software by identifying and correcting defects early in the development process.

## Static Analysis Tools: 
Static analysis tools are software tools that analyze the source code of a program without executing it. They can help developers find and fix errors, bugs, vulnerabilities, code smells, and other quality issues in their code. Static analysis tools can also measure various metrics of the code, such as complexity, readability, maintainability, test coverage, and documentation. Static analysis tools can be integrated into the development process as part of the code editor, the version control system, or the continuous integration pipeline. Some examples of static analysis tools are SonarQube, PMD, ESLint, and Pylint.

List of tools:
Python:
● Mypy
● Pylint
● Pyflakes
● Pycodestyle (pep8)
● Flake8
● Prospector
● Bandit
Java:
● FindBugs
● PMD
● Checkstyle
● Error Prone
● Spoon
● Spotbugs

## Static Analysis of github repositories using `pylint` tool

Static Analysis of audioconvertor.py file using pylint tool :

Based on the error messages given by pylint, here are some points of static analysis for the python code in audioconverter.py:

1. Unnecessary parentheses after 'not' keyword: The 'not' keyword already has a high precedence in Python, so adding parentheses around it is unnecessary and can make the code less readable. Removing the parentheses on line 19 would make the code more concise and easier to understand.

2. Missing module docstring: A module docstring is a good practice to help others understand what the module does, how it works, and how to use it. It should contain a brief summary of the module's purpose and any important details about how it should be used.

3. Multiple imports on one line: It is recommended to have one import statement per line to improve code readability and maintainability. This makes it easier to understand which modules are being imported and makes it easier to find specific imports when making changes to the code.

4. Unable to import 'pydub': This error could be due to a missing or incorrect installation of the 'pydub' module. It could also be due to a typo or other syntax error in the import statement.

5. Constant name "filename" doesn't conform to UPPER_CASE naming style: According to PEP 8 naming conventions, constants should be named using all uppercase letters. Using a different naming convention for constants can make the code harder to read and maintain.

6. Use filename.rsplit('.', maxsplit=1)[-1] instead: Using the rsplit method with the maxsplit argument would be more efficient and easier to read than splitting the string twice. This method splits the string at the last occurrence of the specified delimiter, which in this case is the dot character '.', and returns the last element of the resulting list. This makes it easier to get the file extension without having to count the number of dots in the file name.

Overall, the code has a low rating of 4.12/10 based on pylint's static analysis. The errors found by pylint can be fixed to improve the quality and readability of the code.
